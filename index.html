<h3></a>Why Choose to Work with Shrinkray?</h3>

<p>Owner, Greg Miller loves challenges, working in teams, and solving problems. </p>

<h3>Volunteerism</h3>
      <p>Long ago I joined the Junior Chamber of Commerce, (aka <em>The Jaycees</em>), where I developed professional skills in project management and recruitment.
        While the Jaycess have disappeared, the skills I gained remain. When I have free time I share what I know by helping run a few tech meetups, such as the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Toledo-Web-Professionals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Toledo Web Professionals</a>, Toledo OpenHack, and Google Developer Group.</a>
        These tech events help me stay abreast of changes in technology and give me a chance to meet professionals willing to share.  </p>
