<p>As Shrinkray, I produce web experiences in WordPress and other tools. I started as a designer and storyteller in online training and transitioned to web experiences learning and building as I go. It's not just a tagline, my great interest is <em>...to build enterprising ideas that move</em>.

<p>I have been in the technology industry for 16 years and I have strong soft skills. I enjoy project management, sharing ideas, collaborating and building fun and useful things. </p>

      <p>Long ago I joined the Junior Chamber of Commerce, (aka <em>The Jaycees</em>), where I developed professional skills in project management and recruitment. 
        While the Jaycess have disappeared, the skills I gained remain. When I have free time I share what I know by helping run a few tech meetups, such as the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Toledo-Web-Professionals/" target="_blank">Toledo Web Professionals</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Seed-Coworking/" target="_blank">Toledo OpenHack</a>, and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/GDGToledo/" target="_blank">Google Developer Group.</a> 
        These tech events help me stay abreast of changes in technology and give me a chance to meet professionals willing to share.  </p>
